 <h1>STOP BLACK FEMICIDE EXHIBITION</h1>
 <div class=>
 <p>My name is Iyana Bowden, and this is my artwork for the exhibition in Old Main at Wayne State University. This collection is about Black Femicide and how it affects Black women and girls in Detroit. If you're new to this topic, then you may wonder what is Black Femicide? Black Femicide:  The intentional killing of a Black Woman or girl (usually by males), because they are female and black. This definition was created by Rosa Page; the founder of Black femicide U.S.

 The reason why I am passionate about this topic is because my grandma, Ruby Lenell Bowden, was a victim of Black Femicide. My grandma passed away before I was born, so I never got to meet her. My dad and his siblings lost their mom at a young age; and they still have trauma from it till this day. It angers me when seeing how normalized it is for Black women and girls to be unprotected and killed in this world. Black women and girls deserve to be protected, loved and have a long life. I hope my artwork that I am presenting today is going to help more Black women and girls and spread awareness; because we deserve happiness and protection like anyone else. But most of all, I hope my grandma is proud of me.
